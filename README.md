## Welcome to Security Simulink

The **secrity Simulink** is a programm to show the some Security Encryption Algorithm work. using some animation and Graphic design by using the c# programming language and the .NET Framework.

**Algorithms:**
* [Caesar Cipher](https://github.com/shahabzebare/Security_Simulink#what-in-the-caesar-cipher) 
* [Monoalphabetic Cipher](https://github.com/shahabzebare/Security_Simulink#what-in-the-monoalphabetic-cipher) 
* [Vigenere Cipher](https://github.com/shahabzebare/Security_Simulink#what-in-the-vigenere-cipher) 
* [Playfair Cipher](https://github.com/shahabzebare/Security_Simulink#what-in-the-playfair-cipher) 


#What in the Caesar Cipher.
* In the CAESAR CIPHER interface we have the sequence of English litter Sort from A-Z to,  is a plain litters.
* In the bellow of the plain litters,  we have another sequence of English litter but sorted by the key.  Is a cipher litters.
* In the bottom of the program we have the two **textbox**
  * For the plain text you can enter your message then select key and click to encryption to encrypt the text,or you can click to the play En to show the animation,  for you know how Caesar work for encryption.
  * For the Cipher text you can enter your Cipher message then select key and cllck to de to decrypt the text,or you can cllck to the play De to show the animatlon,  for you know how Caesar work for decryptlon.  

  ####Caesar Cipher Interface:

* In the bottom of the cipher litters we have Track Bar for control the speed of the animation.
* Then we have button for the Example if you clicked it,  the program get Random Example.
* Then we have button for Attack if you clicked it the program show for you new form and send your cipher message to it,  the show you the  message and Next and Back buttons, to try the all key utile show the right message.

  ####Attac Interface:

* The we have the button show Frequency,  to show what the frequency of the letters in the Cipher Text,  and show the Chart Graph of the Frequency of the cipher letters and the frequency of the English letters.

#What in the Monoalphabetic Cipher.
* In the MONOALPHABETIC CIPHER interface we have the sequence of English litter Sort from A-Z to,  is a plain litters.
* In the bellow of the plain litters,  we have another sequence of English litter but is random no sorted,  Is a cipher litters.
* In the bottom of the program we have the two textbox.
 * For the plain text you can enter your message then select loey and click to encryptlon to encrypt the text,  or you can click to the play En to show the anlmation,  for you know how MONOALPHABETIC work for encryption.
 * For the Clpher text you can enter your Clpher message then select key and click to decryption to decrypt the text,or you can click to the play De to show the animation,  for you know how MONOALPHABETIC work for decryption. 

  ####Monoalphabetic Cipher Interface:

* In the bottom of the cipher litters we have Track Bar for control the speed of the animation.
* Then we have button for the Example if you clicked it,  the program get Random Example.
* Then we have button for generate the random key and insert into the cipher letter. 


#What in the Vigenere Cipher.
* In the Vigenere Cipher interface we have the table of English litter.
* In the left of the program we have the three textbox.
 *For the plain text you can enter your message then select key and click to encryption to encrypt the text,or you can click to the play En to show the animation,  for you know how VIGENERE work for encryption.
 * For the Key text,  you can enter your key 
 * For the cipher text you can enter your Cipher message then select key and click to dec to decrypt the text,  or you can click to the play De to show the anlmation,  for you know how VIGENERE work for decryption. 


  ####Vigenere Cipher Interface:

* In the bottom of the cipher litters we have Track Bar for control the speed of the animation.
* Then we have button for the Example if you clicked it,  the program get Random Example.


#What in the Playfair Cipher.
 * In the Playfair Cipher interface we have the table of English litter.
 * In the left of the program we have the three textbox.
  * For the plain text you can enter your message then select key and click to encription to encrypt the text,  or you can click to the plav En to show the animation,  for you know how PLAYEAR work for encryption.
  * For the Key text,  you can enter your key. 
  * For the Cipher text you can enter your Cipher message then select key and click to decryption to decrypt the text Aor you can click to the play De to show the animation,  for you know how PLAYEAIR work for decryption.
